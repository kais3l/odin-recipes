    <p>
        Why buy the boxed stuff when you can make noodles at home? This homemade pasta recipe is way better than what you can buy at the store — and it’s surprisingly easy to throw together with just five ingredients you likely already have on hand!
    </p>
    <h2 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>

       <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
       <li>2 tablespoons water, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <ol class="ordered">
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Mix flour, eggs, olive oil, and salt in a bowl until combined. Add water, 1 teaspoon at a time, to flour mixture until a smooth, thick dough forms.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for 10 minutes. Let dough rest for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 8 balls; use a pasta machine to roll and cut dough into desired pasta shape.</li>
