    </ul>
    <h2 class="steps">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="ordered">
        <li>Boil the veggies first and keep them ready.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of butter and oil in a large pot on medium heat. Once the butter melts and oil is hot, add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped onions and mix. I like to use my food processor to chop them really fine.</li>
        <li>Cook the onions for around 4 minutes until golden brown in color. Add the finely chopped ginger, garlic and green chili. Again, I used my food processor to chop them really fine.</li>
        <li>Add chopped tomatoes and mix well. Let the tomatoes cook for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add tomato puree, 1/4 cup water and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Cover the pan and let the tomato cook for 6 minutes until softened and completely cooked.</li>
        <li>Add the pav bhaji masala, Kashmiri red chili powder, red chili powder and remaining 1 teaspoon of salt. You may also add 1/2 teaspoon of sugar here (optional).</li>
        <li>Mix well and then add in 2 teaspoons of kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves).</li>
        <li>Stir in the boiled veggies and mix.</li>
        <li>Using a potato masher, mash the veggies until they are completely mixed with the masala.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining 3/4  1 cup water and mix. I used an immersion blender to blend the veggies to a paste like consistency, this is optional. You may keep them as such.</li>
        <li>Open the pot and add in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter.</li>
        <li>Add a generous amount of chopped cilantro.</li>
        <li>Then add in juice of 1 large lemon. Let the bhaji simmer for 2 more minutes and then remove pan from heat.</li>
        <li>To toast the pav, melt butter on a pan. Sprinkle some pav bhaji masala on top of the butter and then place the buns on the pan.</li>
        <li>Press to toast the pav until crisp and golden brown from both sides.</li>
    </ol>
